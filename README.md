# Machine-Learning-Behind-the-Curtains
This project is offered by Stamatics , IITK where assignment submittions were based on  ML Algorithm like Regression, classification, clustering, Association Rule Learning, Neural Networks and CNNs. 

This repository contains all the three assignments which were a part of this project.
## ðŸ“Œ Assignment 1 :
In this assignment, we explored the basics of Linear Algebra for Machine Learning, and practised some important functions availabe in python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib. 

## ðŸ“Œ Assignment 2:
This assignment primarily focusses on implementing the basic functions of the Gradient Descent algorithm from scratch using only numpy and pandas to find the boundary in a small dataset.

## ðŸ“Œ Assignment 3:
In this assignment, you will build your first neural network, which will have a hidden layer. You will see a big difference between this model and another model implmented using logistic regression.

At last we comared the accuracy of both the models and pointed relevant conclusions regarding drawbacks of logistic regression over Artificial Neural Network built from the scratch.

we learn how to:

Implement a 2-class classification neural network with a single hidden layer
Use units with a non-linear activation function, such as tanh
Compute the cross entropy loss
Implement forward and backward propagation
